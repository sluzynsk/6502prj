# 6502prj
Firmware for my hand built 6502 based 8 bit microcomputer

(C) 2020 Steven Luzynski <steve@luzynski.net>

The beginnings of this are taken with appreciation from Dirk Grappendorf's excellent tutorial/devblog at 
https://www.grappendorf.net/projects/6502-home-computer/

Quite some divergence will occur along the road as I intend to figure out a
USB keyboard and a video display system of some sort and avoid all the
serial I/O business so popular in homebrew 8 bit micros.

Real project name will come when I'm inspired.
